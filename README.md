# Smallest Window Substring Finder Project

## Description
This Java project develops an algorithm to identify the smallest substring in a given string that includes all characters from another string. It utilizes object-oriented principles and design patterns like Decorator, Factory, and Strategy for a modular and flexible code structure.
## Features
- **Algorithm**: Utilizes a sliding window technique to find the smallest substring.
- **Design Patterns**:
    - **Decorator**: Enhances functionality with additional features like caching and logging without modifying the core logic.
    - **Strategy**: Enables flexible swapping of different substring search algorithms.
    - **Factory**: Simplifies the creation of strategy instances.
